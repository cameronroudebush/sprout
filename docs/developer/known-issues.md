# Known Issues

Just like every application, there's some issues that we just can't seem to fix because, normally, it's out of our hands. Below is a table of exactly that.

## Web Autofill

Some browsers that try to auto-fill with password managers may experience issues where the input flickers but nothing happens. Unfortunately, this is out of our hands and is [reported directly to the flutter developers](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/127694). We'll have to wait for a result on that to see if it gets fixed.

In the meantime, we suggest using one of the [App's](../getting-started/access.md#apps) as they won't have this issue.
