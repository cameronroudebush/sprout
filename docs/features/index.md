Sprout offers a robust set of tools designed to help you visualize your financial picture at a glance. While not strictly a budgeting app, Sprout focuses on **Net Worth Tracking**—helping you understand exactly where your money is parked, where it is going, and how it grows over time.

Here are the core features available to help you manage your wealth:

## Dashboard (Home)

The Dashboard is your central hub for a complete financial overview. It aggregates your most critical data into a clean, unified display so you don't have to jump between screens to know where you stand.

- **Net Worth Overview:** A real-time calculation of your assets minus liabilities, showing you the big picture of your financial health.
- **Account Summary:** View balances across all your connected accounts—banks, investments, credit cards, and loans—in one place.
- **Asset & Liability Breakdown:** Visual gauges that quickly show your asset allocation versus your debt load.
- **Recent Activity:** A snapshot of your latest transactions to keep you aware of immediate spending.

## Transactions

Your complete financial history, accessible in one place. The Transactions view is built for performance, allowing you to scroll through your entire history seamlessly.

- **Search & Filter:** Quickly find specific past purchases by merchant, date, or amount.
- **Detailed Insights:** Drill down into individual transactions to see dates, categories, and merchant details.
- **Daily Breakdown:** See exactly how much you spent on any given day.

## Cash Flow

Understanding _how_ your money moves is just as important as knowing _how much_ you have. The Cash Flow view visualizes your income and expenses over time.

- **Trend Analysis:** View line and bar charts to spot spending trends month-over-month.
- **Category Breakdown:** Pie charts help you identify which categories are consuming the largest portion of your budget.
- **Sankey Diagram:** A powerful visualization that maps the flow of every dollar from income source to final expense category, giving you unmatched clarity on your spending efficiency.

## AI Assistant (Chat)

Sprout integrates an AI-powered assistant that allows you to interact with your financial data using natural language.

- **Ask Questions:** Instead of manually filtering reports, simply ask, _"How much did I spend on groceries last month?"_ or _"What is my current net worth?"_
- **Data Summaries:** Get quick, automated insights into your financial habits.
- _Note: For details on capabilities and data usage, please review the [LLM documentation](../getting-started/llm.md)._

## Rules Engine

Manual categorization is tedious, so Sprout automates it. The Rules Engine keeps your data organized without the manual work.

- **Auto-Categorization:** Create logic based on merchant names or transaction values to automatically assign categories to new purchases.
- **Retroactive Updates:** Apply new rules to past transactions to instantly clean up your historical data.
- **Consistent Reporting:** Ensures your charts and reports are accurate by standardizing how transactions are labeled.

## Custom Categories

Your finances are unique, and your tracking should be too. Sprout allows you to define a category structure that fits your lifestyle.

- **Custom Tags:** Create, rename, and organize categories to match how you actually spend.
- **Visual Icons:** Assign icons to categories for quick recognition in your transaction feed and charts.
- **Unified Reporting:** Your custom categories integrate automatically across all reports and dashboards.

## Subscription Tracking

Recurring charges can easily go unnoticed. Sprout analyzes your transaction history to help you stay on top of your commitments.

- **Auto-Detection:** The system identifies consistent, recurring charges (within a 10% variance) to flag potential subscriptions.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Tracks how often you are charged, helping you audit your monthly obligations and identify unused services.
