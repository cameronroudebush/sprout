      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="center">This privacy policy is designed to inform you about how your data is handled when you use the Sprout application.</p>
        <h2>Data Ownership and Control</h2>
        <p>
          Sprout is a <strong>self-hosted application</strong>, which means you, the user, have complete control and ownership of your data. The application is
          designed to run on your own infrastructure, such as a personal server or computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data, including financial information, account balances, and transaction history, is stored exclusively on your self-hosted backend.
          <strong>The developer of Sprout does not have any access to, or control over, your personal or financial information.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>No Data Collection by the Developer</h2>
        <p>
          The developer and any associated parties do not collect, store, or process any user data from your instance of the Sprout application. There are no
          tracking mechanisms, analytics, or remote logging functions that transmit your information to us.
        </p>
        <p>Your data remains entirely within your network connection you maintain and on your designated storage.</p>

        <h2>Secure Notifications</h2>
        <p>
          If you choose to configure push notifications, Sprout utilizes a <strong>"Secure Fetch"</strong> architecture to protect your privacy. When a
          notification occurs, your self-hosted server sends a generic, data-free signal to your device via Google Firebase. Upon receiving this signal, the
          Sprout application wakes up and establishes a direct, secure connection to your self-hosted instance to download the actual notification content.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ensures that <strong>no sensitive notification content is ever transmitted through third-party push services</strong> or the developer's
          infrastructure. The actual text and details of your notifications never leave the direct connection between your device and your self-hosted server.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>As the self-hoster of the Sprout application, you are responsible for the security and management of your data. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Securing your server and network.</li>
          <li>Backing up your data.</li>
          <li>Managing user access to your self-hosted instance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the application's functionality. We encourage you to review the latest version of this
          policy on our website.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact the developer through the official GitHub repository.</p>
