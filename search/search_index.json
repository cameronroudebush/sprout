The application is           designed to run on your own infrastructure, such as a personal server or computer.         </p> <p>           All data, including financial information, account balances, and transaction history, is stored exclusively on your self-hosted backend.           The developer of Sprout does not have any access to, or control over, your personal or financial information. </p> No Data Collection by the Developer <p>           The developer and any associated parties do not collect, store, or process any user data from your instance of the Sprout application. There are no           tracking mechanisms, analytics, or remote logging functions that transmit your information to us.         </p> <p>Your data remains entirely within your network connection you maintain and on your designated storage.</p> Secure Notifications <p>           If you choose to configure push notifications, Sprout utilizes a \"Secure Fetch\" architecture to protect your privacy. When a           notification occurs, your self-hosted server sends a generic, data-free signal to your device via Google Firebase. Upon receiving this signal, the           Sprout application wakes up and establishes a direct, secure connection to your self-hosted instance to download the actual notification content.         </p> <p>           This ensures that no sensitive notification content is ever transmitted through third-party push services or the developer's           infrastructure. The actual text and details of your notifications never leave the direct connection between your device and your self-hosted server.         </p> Your Responsibilities <p>As the self-hoster of the Sprout application, you are responsible for the security and management of your data. This includes:</p> <ul> <li>Securing your server and network.</li> <li>Backing up your data.</li> <li>Managing user access to your self-hosted instance.</li> </ul> Changes to this Policy <p>           This policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in the application's functionality.

Here is an honest assessment of where it shines and where it faces challenges compared to enterprise-grade aggregators (like Plaid).</p> Strength Area for Improvement Simplicity: The REST API is incredibly straightforward and easy to debug. Data Freshness: Syncs are not always real-time. Data is cached and refreshed periodically (usually daily), which prevents \"instant\" update experiences. Cost: It is significantly cheaper than enterprise alternatives, making it very accessible. Metadata Richness: Transaction data is sometimes sparse. Merchant logos, precise geolocations, and categorized merchant codes are often missing or less detailed. Privacy: It acts as a strict read-only proxy, reducing the risk surface for developers. Connection Stability: As a bridge often relying on other aggregators (like MX) under the hood, connection stability is dependent on the upstream provider, not just SimpleFIN itself.
